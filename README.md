Eiffel Monopoly
===============

A graphical monopoly made in Eiffel

If you are only interested in the game, you can go to the [compiled/](https://github.com/pec0ra/eiffel_monopoly/tree/master/compiled) folder and download one of the zip file.
The executable alone will not work. It needs the images.
